Description: Length of mRNA transcripts for a number of genomes and gene ID 
    formats, largely based on UCSC table browser. Data objects are provided as
    individual pieces of information to be retrieved and loaded. A variety of 
    different gene identifiers and genomes is supported to ensure wide 
    applicability.
